              adventure, hope and never giving up even in the most dire
              circumstances.

              One thing I will say for this author is that he is very good at
              making up magical creatures with amazing names and his illustrator
              is equally good at drawing them! The picture of Mag, the terrible
              termagant trog, straight after her change has to be seen to be
              believed.

              A childhood favourite of mine that I just re-read for the first
              time in twenty years and I adore it still! I am so relieved I
              didn't think it was not as good as when I was a child, as that has
              happened with re-reading some of my childhood favourites.

              This is one of those series, like the famous Harry Potter, and
              like the Chrestomanci series of Diana Wynne Jones, that I used to
              fervently and desperately wish were real. Or rather, that felt so
              real incredibly real that I simply couldn't believe they weren't.

              I was really surprised about this series. Not because of the fact
              that it was bad. It was actually better then I thought it would
              be. The thing that surprised me is that this is considered a
              children's series and the rather disturbing stuff that goes on in
              here.

              What a blast of nostalgic fun! Now I remember why I used to love
              these books so much when I was a kid.

              The book graphics are outstanding. Worth the read for that alone.
              This is a YA series. Good for cleaning your palette and tickling
              your funny bone.

              Very imaginative and moody. The setting is dark and colourful and
              a little bit twisted, with frequent gross-out moments to appeal to
              the target audience. However, Many of the scenes appeared to
              randomly follow the last one, and a lot of bizarre stuff occurs
              for no given reason.
