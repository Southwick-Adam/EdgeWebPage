            <h3>Beyond the Deep Woods</h3>
            <p>
              Young Twig lives in the Deepwoods, among the Woodtrolls, but he
              isn't one of them. In a brave attempt to find where he belongs,
              Twig wanders into the mysterious world beyond the Deepwoods. He
              meets a collection of odd companions, such as his wise guardian,
              the Caterbird; the Slaughterers, a peaceful race who butcher
              animals; and the vicious, bile-swilling Rotsucker. Twig
              steadfastly pursues his quest until he discovers his roots, not
              among the trees, but in the skies…

            <h3>Storm Chaser</h3>
            <p>
              Sixteen-year-old Twig is eager to begin his new life as a sky
              pirate on board the famous Stormchaser. The crew's quest: to
              collect stormphrax—the precious, magical substance formed at the
              heart of a storm—in order to save the floating city of
              Sanctaphrax. Only a sky ship as powerful as the Stormchaser,
              piloted by a man as fearless as Cloud Wolf, could risk entering
              such a storm...

            <p>
              Sweeping in from the open sky, the Mother Storm must strike the
              source of the Edgewater River to bring new energy to the land. But
              in its way is Sanctaphrax, a magnificent city built on a floating
              rock and tethered to the land. Only one person can save the
              Edgelands from certain disaster: Twig, the young sky pirate
              captain who dared to sail over the Edge, and returned with his
              memory shattered. But to recover his memory, Twig must first find
              his lost crew. And this means a journey back into the Deepwoods...

              Academe, who needs an apprentice he can trust to carry out a
              series of highly important tasks. Just how important, Quint is
              about to find out as he and Linius's only daughter, Maris, are
              plunged into the midst of a terrifying adventure that takes them
              deep within the rock upon which Sanctaphrax is built...

              mysteries of their world. Breaking all the rules, he sets out on a
