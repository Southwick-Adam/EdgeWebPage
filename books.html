              <h3>Beyond the Deep Woods</h3>
              <p>
                Young Twig lives in the Deepwoods, among the Woodtrolls, but he
                isn't one of them. In a brave attempt to find where he belongs,
                Twig wanders into the mysterious world beyond the Deepwoods. He
                meets a collection of odd companions, such as his wise guardian,
                the Caterbird; the Slaughterers, a peaceful race who butcher
                animals; and the vicious, bile-swilling Rotsucker. Twig
                steadfastly pursues his quest until he discovers his roots, not
                among the trees, but in the skies…

              <h3>Storm Chaser</h3>
              <p>
                Sixteen-year-old Twig is eager to begin his new life as a sky
                pirate on board the famous Stormchaser. The crew's quest: to
                collect stormphrax—the precious, magical substance formed at the
                heart of a storm—in order to save the floating city of
                Sanctaphrax. Only a sky ship as powerful as the Stormchaser,
                piloted by a man as fearless as Cloud Wolf, could risk entering
                such a storm...

              <p>
                Sweeping in from the open sky, the Mother Storm must strike the
                source of the Edgewater River to bring new energy to the land.
                But in its way is Sanctaphrax, a magnificent city built on a
                floating rock and tethered to the land. Only one person can save
                the Edgelands from certain disaster: Twig, the young sky pirate
                captain who dared to sail over the Edge, and returned with his
                memory shattered. But to recover his memory, Twig must first
                find his lost crew. And this means a journey back into the
                Deepwoods...
